# JPN n3DS Filtering Disabler

## Introduction
New3DSes sold in Japan have content filtering that is very powerful, so powerful that it says you can't access Spotify because it's streaming music(?)  
I wonder what kind of mature content I can find there ðŸ‘€  
In order to remove the filtering, you _had_ to pay a tiny amount of money via credit card.  
Now? You can't remove it at all because they've stopped supporting credit cards on eshop.  

So here's a GM9(GodMode9) script to disable(and re-enable) the filtering.  

## Versions
Both \_en.gm9 and \_ja.gm9 do the same thing, but messages in \_en.gm9 are in English and those in \_ja.gm9 are in Katakana.  

## Requirement
\_en.gm9: GodMode9 v1.9.2pre1 or above  
\_ja.gm9: GodMode9 v2.1.0 or above  

## Note
You have to have opened the browser at least once before using this script so that it can modify the savedata.  

## License

For more details, see ```LICENSE```  

## Disclaimer
The script modifies certain part of the browser's savedata.  
Although I have confirmed it did disable and enable the filtering without visible trace of detection by the browser, I cannot assertively deny the possibility that the browser is aware of it or a future version of the browser detects it.  
Please use it at your own risk.
